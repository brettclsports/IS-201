                        <p>I have always enjoyed going to parties and dances since I was age 14. In LA where I grew up, the local Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints would put on dances for kids between 14 and 18 years old. I found every moment I could to attend these dances. My mom knew since I loved them so much if I ever miss behaved it would be my consequence to not attend. I went almost 3 times a month to these themed dances from age 14 to 18. This is what sparked my love for a high energy atmosphere surrounded by people that want to have fun and party.</p>
                        <p>I come from a family background involved in themed decorating and entertainment. So my whole life I have helped put on parties with my parents. One of the things we did for our business was put on the local church dances for the youth several times a year. Since we helped put on the dances we also were in charge of playing the music. My older brother James loved getting to DJ these events, but once he left the house for college at age 18, I then was in charge of playing the music for the dances. I wasn't the typical DJ. I would play the music, and then jump down to the dance floor to go dance with my friends and pump the crowd up. This continued until I left for college, followed by a two year service mission in Cusco, Peru for my church.</p>
                        <p>Near the end of my two years in Cusco, Peru, my dad sent me a message telling me about a bunch of DJ equipment he got for sale and purchased. He asked if I would be interested in DJ as a job to help pay for college. He said, "There is nothing better than getting paid to go have fun at a party." I loved that thought. I already knew when I got back to the states that I would be going to parties and dances anyway. Therefore what better way to do that then as a form of employment. Of course I told him, "YES!!!"</p>
                        <p>Once I arrived home I began the journey of learning to DJ. I acquired a mixer board and watched videos to learn the steps behind DJing and the how to's of putting on a good event for my clients. I performed at my first event at the Irvine Spectrum Mall on Black Friday, then at the Pasadena Museum of Heritage in LA. I soon flew from Utah to LA to DJ a Prom. The events began to pick up. I cannot thank my parents enough for providing me with this opportunity.</p>
                        <p>Things became rough for my parents and I once COVID-19 hit. Events immediately stopped. It was hard for everybody in the entertainment and party industry. None of us had a job. It was only a matter of time of waiting before events would eventually pick up again.</p>
                        <p>Once the beginning of 2021 rolled around, I met up with my friend Cale Sieverts and Mike Jensen, and began throwing our own parties. One event picked up after another and soon many kids around Provo were talking about the parties that DJ Brett LIVE puts on and DJ’s. What makes me the most happy to see is the fun, high energy atmosphere I can provide DJing for the guests at each party. The parties went from DJing in front of my apartment, to DJing off my balcony after a concert, being the finale show DJing at the end of a concert for 300 college students that danced like I have never seen. Later that summer of 2021 I produced a Black Light Neon Paint Dance Party and brought in a professional performing group called Golden Hour that performed in between my mixes for the event.</p>
                        <p>The events continued. I DJ for Corporate Events, Weddings, Private Parties, School Dances, you name it. My name is DJ Brett LIVE. I love to party, I love to DJ, I love dancing, I love interacting with the guests and making every event the most fun, high energy, and memorable event for everybody.</p>
